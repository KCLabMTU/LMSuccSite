### Introduction
Improving Protein Succinylation Sites Prediction Using Features Extracted from Protein Language Model

### Model Evaluation using the existing benchmark independent test set
Please run the `evaluate_model.py` script.

### To predict your own sequence 
In order to predict succinylation site using your own sequence, you need to have two inputs:
1. Sequence Peptide of size 33
2. The ProtT5 features of the sequence extracted from that particular site residue.


### To train the model using our training set (To be updated)


### To train the model using your own dataset (To be updated)
